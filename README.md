# Password Complexity Checker

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the strength of their passwords based on predefined complexity rules. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide an interactive experience, ensuring users create strong and secure passwords.

## Features
- **Password Strength Indicator**: A dynamic strength meter that shows the password's strength based on length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special character requirements.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant validation as users type their passwords.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the password checker.
- **CSS**: Ensures a clean, user-friendly interface through styling.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for password validation and displays feedback.
